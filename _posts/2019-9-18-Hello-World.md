title: A brief Self-introduction

I am a computational linguistics student. I would like to become a data scientist specializing in sentiment analysis after graduation. I am a big jazz fan. I also like tennis and soccer. If you like Manchester United, we can be friends. If you are Liverpool or Man City fan, then, Congrats... But please remember, we will be back!!!
